#sadness

Didn't feel like doing too much today.

- HTML: basic stuff
- CSS: used percentages for animations instead of from/to like last time. 
- JS: had to look up how to trigger the css animation. once i found the "animation play state" property, it was pretty straight forward from there. 

That's all. 11/27/18
